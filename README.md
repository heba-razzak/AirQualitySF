# AirQualitySF

## Overview

The primary objective of the project is to develop a robust predictive model for PM2.5 concentrations in the Bay Area.

To achieve this goal, the project integrates and analyzes diverse datasets sourced from PurpleAir, OpenStreetMap (OSM), Uber speeds, and weather stations.
